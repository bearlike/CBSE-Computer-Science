# Getting Started ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Using Jupyter Notebooks üìì
- The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text.
- These features make Jupyter Notebook interactive, an attribute that makes it a valuable tool for beginners.
- I recommend using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bearlike/CBSE-Computer-Science/HEAD) to run all Jupyter notebooks in this repository on the cloud since it's free and no setup is required.
